              <h3>The Road to enlightenment</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-especific tags,
              incompatible <a href="#" class="nolink">DOM</a>s, broken <a href="#" class="nolink">CSS</a> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
          <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been archieved thanks to
              the tireless efforts of folk like the <a href="#" class="nolink">W3C</a>, <a href="#" class="nolink">WaSP</a>, and the major browser creators.</p>
          <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the 
              masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and
              invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

            <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
        </header>
          <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire
               and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list.
               Clinking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <a href="#" class="nolink">HTML</a> remains the same,
               the only thing that has changed is the external <a href="#" class="nolink">CSS</a> file. Yes, really.</p>
          <p><a href="#" class="nolink">CSS</a> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way 
                this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it 
                truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from
                structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can
                always push it further.</p>

              <h3>Participation</h3>
          </header>
            <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <a href="#" class="nolink">CSS</a>
                 skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even <a href="#" class="nolink">CSS</a>
                 novices can use them as starting points. Please see the <a href='#'>CSS Resource Guide</a> for advanced
                 tutorials and tips on working with CSS.</p>
            <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <a href="#" class="nolink">HTML</a>. This may seem daunting
                  at first if you've never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more,
                  and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
            <p>Download the sample <a href='#'>HTML</a> and <a href='#'>CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece
                  (and please, don't submit half-finished work) upload your <a href="#" class="nolink">CSS</a> file to a web server under your
                  control. <a href='#'>Send us</a> a link to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose
                  to use it we will download it and place it our server.</p>

                   people how amazing <a href="#" class="nolink">CSS</a> really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those
                   working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future
                   techniques we can all look forward to.</p>
